On **Mondays**, I will review the week's course materials, including the discussion post topic and the zybook assignment material, while also monitoring the progress of ongoing projects. I will then start work on the zybook tasks, focusing on completion of the initial three sections, which typically serve as the covered content for discussion posts. Moving to **Tuesdays**, my attention will remain on the zybook assignments, alongside the drafting of the initial discussion post. The aim is to have it posted by Tuesday evening or, at the latest, by Wednesday. The concluding 20-30 minutes of my study time will be reserved for mid-class projects, allowing for early identification of potential challenges and enabling timely communication to professors or other resources if necessary. \n\nOn **Wednesdays**, I'll either publish my discussion post or, if that's already accomplished, respond to a peer's post. My primary focus will then shift to zybook assignments and additional readings, with the final 20-30 minutes of the day reserved for project tasks. **Thursdays** will predominantly be spent on finalizing the zybook assignments, accompanied by note-taking on pivotal content. Given that discussion posts would likely be sorted by now, I'll refocus 30-40 minutes specifically towards upcoming projects. As the week winds down on **Friday**, I plan to monitor and engage with replies to my discussion posts during both morning and evening sessions. Should I not have made two discussion contributions by this time, the evening will see my second post, followed by wrapping up any remaining zybook lessons. Over the **weekend**, both Saturday and Sunday will involve 1-2 hours to zybook assignments if required, and a steadfast hour dedicated daily to project work. If Zybooks assignments are complete, then I will focus the entire time on class projectes. This plan is developed to offer clarity and efficiency in my academic journey while ensuring minimized stress and sustained mental clarity.","tags":[],"_id":"note:DBYpiVn9L","_rev":"6-f530ac84459986ff682cfe56e214c5a9"}
